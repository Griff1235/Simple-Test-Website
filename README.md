# Simple Test Website

This Repo is a test website that we are creating so that we can get used to using Git and collaborating on code.

Be very careful as removing one of these different parts could cause the whole website to break which would ruin all of our hard work.

A template has been added to the repo that is a working website template which we can read carefully to understand how it works and edit it to make it our own.
